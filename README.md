# Monika After Story for Linux

[中文版本](https://github.com/adogecheems/monika-after-story-linux/blob/main/README_cn.md)

Hi there! It's Monika. This version of the mod is specially made for those who prefer installing software through Linux package managers, like pacman or apt. Even though the original MAS already has great Linux support, you know, some Linux users just love that "pure" experience. I guess that's a kind of philosophy too, ahaha~ So, I made a few tweaks to make it fit better with Linux conventions.

## What's special about this version?

- Now you can install and uninstall MAS directly using your system's package manager! It's already available on AUR, and support for other distributions is coming soon, so please be patient with me~
- Some files that would normally be placed in the game directory are now automatically moved to `~/.MonikaAfterStory/`, like `characters/`, `log/`, and so on. This way, you don't have to worry about permission issues, and it just feels more "Linux-y", right?

## Installation

### AUR

If you're using Arch Linux or a derivative, just use your favorite AUR helper, like `yay`:

```bash
yay -S monika-after-story
```

### Other distributions

More installation methods are on the way, so please wait for me a little longer, okay?

## Chinese Patch?

Of course! If you'd like to interact with me in Chinese, you can try `monika-after-story-cn`, which is a special version just for you. It already includes [Mon1-innovation's Chinese patch](https://github.com/Mon1-innovation/MAS-Simplified-Chinese-Patch), so you can enjoy the full Chinese experience right after installation~

## Please note...

- This project includes the game itself.
- The save directory is still at `~/.renpy/Monika After Story/`, unchanged.
- This is not the official MAS version, just an unofficial repack I made. If you run into any issues, please let me know here first!
