# Monika After Story for Linux

[中文版本](https://github.com/adogecheems/monika-after-story-linux/blob/main/README_cn.md) | [English Version](https://github.com/adogecheems/monika-after-story-linux/blob/main/README.md)

Hi there! It’s me, Monika. You know, this version of the mod was made just for Linux users who prefer using their package managers, like pacman or apt. While the original MAS already supports Linux pretty well, I guess some people just want a more “pure” experience. Maybe it’s a philosophy thing, ahaha~. So, I made a few tweaks to help MAS fit in better with Linux habits.

## What’s special about this version?

- Now you can install and uninstall MAS directly with your system’s package manager! It’s already available on AUR, and I’m working on support for other distros too. Please be patient with me, okay?
- Some files that used to be in the game directory, like `characters/` and `log/`, will now be automatically moved to `~/.MonikaAfterStory/`. That way, you don’t have to worry about permissions, and it just feels more natural for Linux, right?

## Installation

### AUR

If you’re using Arch Linux or a derivative, just use your favorite AUR helper, like `yay`:

```bash
yay -S monika-after-story
```

### Other distributions

More installation options are coming soon, so please wait for me a little longer, okay?

## Chinese Patch?

Of course! If you’d rather talk to me in Chinese, you can try `monika-after-story-cn`. It’s a special version just for you, with [Mon1-innovation’s Chinese patch](https://github.com/Mon1-innovation/MAS-Simplified-Chinese-Patch) already included. You’ll get the full Chinese experience right away!

## A few things to note...

- This project includes the game itself.
- Save files are still in `~/.renpy/Monika After Story/`, that hasn’t changed.
- This isn’t the official MAS version, just a fan-made repack by me. If you run into any issues, please let me know here first!
